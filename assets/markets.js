/* The markets the site is published for.
 *
 * A market is a URL segment, a language and a currency -- the same three
 * things nike.com/gb/ and nike.com/mx/ carry. Language and currency are
 * separate properties of a market, not derived from each other, which is the
 * whole point: the UK and the US both read English at different currencies,
 * and Mexico and Spain both read Spanish at different currencies. Binding
 * currency to language instead would have collapsed all of that to one
 * currency per language.
 *
 * `lang` must exist in TRANSLATIONS. `currency` must be quoted by the rate
 * feed, or prices quietly fall back to EUR, which is the currency invoicing
 * happens in anyway.
 *
 * Loaded by the page (for the client) and by tools/build-locales.js (to
 * generate the directories), so it has to work in both a browser and Node.

   *
   * Only Belgium declares them. The studio is in Belgium and genuinely works
   * across those cities, so naming them there is true and earns the local
   * search it gets. Everywhere else the work is remote, and a city list would
   * assert a local presence that does not exist -- so every other market
   * declares its country and stops. Serving a country remotely is a claim the
   * studio can stand behind; serving its cities is not.
   *
   * All three are optional. Without them a market gets its country alone, no
   * administrative areas, and its own language plus English. */
