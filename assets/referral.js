   REFERRAL CAPTURE

   A marketing partner hands out a link with their code on it:

       https://drpbuildlab.com/?ref=LOTTE24

   This remembers the code and puts it on the quote request, so the quote that
   comes out of that request can carry the visitor's 10% and the partner's 5%.
   That is the whole job. Everything after the form submission -- issuing the
   code, discounting the quote, booking the commission when the invoice is
   paid, the partner's dashboard, the monthly payout -- happens in the client
   portal, which is a different application and not in this repository. What
   this file guarantees is that the attribution is not lost between the click
   and the request, which is the one part that has to live on the website.

   ── Why this is not behind the cookie banner ──
   The visitor followed a link whose entire purpose is a discount they are
   asking for. Storing the code is what delivers the thing they requested, so
   it sits with the strictly-necessary storage rather than with analytics or
   advertising -- it is first-party, it is read by nobody but this site, and
   it is never used to build a profile or follow anyone anywhere else. It is
   written even when the banner is dismissed, and consent.js is not consulted.
   If legal advice comes back the other way, the fix is a consent check at
   remember() and nothing else changes.

   ── No expiry ──
   A stored code does not run out. A partner's link counts until DRP BuildLab
   revokes it, and that is enforced in the client zone, which resolves the
   code against the partner's status when the request arrives. The browser
   only keeps the code; ts records when it was first clicked.

   ── First code wins ──
   If a visitor arrives on a second partner's link while a code is still
   stored, the first one is kept. Last-click would let a partner overwrite
   somebody else's referral by getting their link in front of a reader who
   was already sold, and first-click is the rule that cannot be gamed that
   way. It is stated on the partner page so nobody has to guess.

     This governs the URL only. The visitor can now type a code into the form
     themselves, and that field is deliberately not held to this pattern --
     the site has no list of real codes, so rejecting one here could only ever
     be a guess, and a guess that refuses a genuine code costs a sale. The
