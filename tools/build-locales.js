 * Generates a directory per market from the four source pages.

 * Output is committed, not built on Netlify. A build command is one more
 * thing that can fail on deploy, and this site has already had one outage
 * from a netlify.toml change -- generated files in git are inspectable in a

 *
 * What each generated page gets that the source does not:
 *   - <html lang> for the market's language
 *   - a canonical pointing at itself, not at the source page
 *   - hreflang alternates covering every market, plus x-default
 *   - internal links prefixed with the market segment
 *   - window.__DRP_MARKET__, so the client knows its market without
 *     having to parse the URL
 *   - a <script> for its own language's translations only, generated
 *     alongside the pages into assets/i18n.<lang>.js
 *
 * Body copy is still translated client-side by app.js, exactly as it is
 * today. This step gets the URLs, the metadata and the currency right; the
 * text is a separate problem and prerendering it can follow.

 *
 * pruneBuildDir() deletes every hash the current build did not emit, on the
 * reasoning that an old hash is dead weight and is exactly what a stale page
 * would still resolve. That is right about the weight and backwards about
 * the failure: resolving last build's stylesheet renders the site slightly
 * out of date, and resolving nothing renders it as unstyled markup -- serif
 * text, blue underlined links, an SVG logo three screens tall. One of those
 * is a blemish and the other is an outage, and deleting the file chooses the
 * outage.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. It was reported from production on /lu/ within the
 * hour of a deploy, and every previous styles.<hash>.css returns 404. HTML is
 * served must-revalidate, so this needs a browser holding a page from before
 * the deploy and re-fetching a stylesheet it had evicted -- a restored
 * session, a back-forward navigation, a tab open across the deploy. Rare per
 * visit, certain across enough visits, and total when it happens.
 *
 * So the hashed reference carries a fallback to the unhashed original, which
 * is written by this same build, deployed beside it, and served
 * max-age=0 must-revalidate -- always current, never cached long. The
 * fallback only fires on a failed load, costs one attribute, and turns the
 * outage back into nothing at all.
 *
 * Only assets that exist unhashed under /assets/ get one. The generated
 * payloads -- i18n.<lang>.js, lang-offer.js, rates.boot.js -- have no
 * unhashed twin, and pointing at one would swap a 404 for a different 404.
 *
 * Scripts are re-inserted with async=false, which is what makes a
 * dynamically added script keep its order relative to the others rather than
 * executing the moment it arrives: app.js reads what i18n and locale set up,
 * and a fallback that ran early would be a subtler version of this same bug. */
