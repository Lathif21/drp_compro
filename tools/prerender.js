 * Bakes the translated text into the generated market pages.
 *
 *   node tools/build-locales.js     # structure: URLs, canonical, hreflang
 *   node tools/prerender.js         # text: this script
 *
 * Run the two in that order. build-locales.js rewrites the market
 * directories from src/, which throws away anything this script did, so
 * prerender always runs second.
 *
 * Why a browser rather than translating in Node: applyLang() in app.js maps
 * 126 translation keys onto the DOM through a long list of selectors. Any
 * reimplementation here would be a second copy of that mapping, and the two
 * would drift the first time somebody edited one of them. Loading the page
 * and letting the real applyLang run means the output is by construction
 * whatever the site would have shown anyway.
 *
 * Before this, every market page shipped Dutch body text with a <html lang>
 * claiming otherwise -- /jp/ told crawlers it was Japanese and handed them
 * "Jouw bedrijf". The pages were indexable in structure but not in content.
 *
 * Requires playwright-core and a Chromium build:
 *   npm install
 *   npx playwright install chromium      (once, if you have no Chromium yet)
 *
 * Netlify never runs this. The output is committed, like build-locales.js.
